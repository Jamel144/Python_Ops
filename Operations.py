#Slice string string[0:3] prints first 4 letters of the string

# reverse characters in a string string[::-1] returns string backwards 

# Repeat string repeated_string = string * 3 returns new variable of the string repeated 

# Replace letter in string, string.replace("A", "B") replaces first character with the 2nd case sensitive 

# change item to float float(item)

# change item to intenger int(item)

# Total number of variables = total_number_variables = sum([num1, num2, num3]) = Return all variable total.

# round a float or intenger to two decimal places round(intenger, 2)    /or formatted {intenger:.2f}

# use // when dividing numbers to get an intenger back otherwise it will be a float 

# To find the modulo (remainder) is 7 % 3 = 1 (7 / 3 is leaves one as a remainder so the modulo is 1) 
    # can also be used to find out if a number is odd or even by using (number % 2) = 0 is even/ = 1 is odd.

# ** isthe exponentiation operator. It is used to raise a number (the base) to the power of another number (the exponent).
    #so (2**3) (base ** exponent) = 8 (2*2*3) = 8

    # PEMDAS stands for:

    # AS: Addition + and Subtraction - (from left to right)
